### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nicolas Ramirez, I am a mathematician with a Master's degree from Universidad Nacional de Colombia. 
My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, particularly in the fields of natural language processing and machine learning. 
I have a strong background in category theory and am interested in exploring how it can be applied to machine learning.
